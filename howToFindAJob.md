#How to Find a Job

> Real Listing: Wanted Social Media Manager. Must have 10 years experience.

note: hiliarious because there was no such thing as social media 10 years ago.

Theres a nasty dance between employers, and talent. Really nasty. Throw in some recruiters and a job market that is desperate for talent and you have yourself a wholly mess. Not to fear, I've compiled some healthy concepts for you to utilize to best get yourself employed.

1. Don't look for a job. Look for a person. 

Hate to burst your bubble but at the end of every resume you send out and every taleo database entry there is a person. Some of these people hate to be contacted... Don't worry about them. A real job search starts will finding a person.
